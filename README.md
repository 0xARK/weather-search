## In which context did I this project?

I did this project as part of my studies in IT. This is a graded project for my fourth semester.

## The goal of the project

The goal of this project was to learn what an api was and to consume it asynchronously (without reloading the page) using the XmlHttpRequest object and AJAX. We then had to format this data to make a small web application.

## Installation

No installation is required. If you want to try it, just clone this repo :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xARK/weather-search
```

Then, move in `client` directory and open `index.html` page in a browser
